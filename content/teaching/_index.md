## Undergraduate Mentoring
In 2021, I supervised a team of nine undergraduates collecting data on the newspaper coverage of unilateral presidential actions. I developed a unique training and monitoring program for the task, publishing what I learned in an  <font style="color:#FFCB05;">[article](../improving-content-analysis-tools-for-working-with-undergraduate-research-assistants.pdf)</font> and associated  <font style="color:#FFCB05;">[R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ura/index.html)</font>.

In 2022-2023, I supervised a lab of Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) students. We used personnel records of correctional officers in Mississippi and Arkansas to examine descriptive representation in the carceral state. The students presented their work at a poster session at MPSA (poster available <font style="color:#FFCB05;">[here](../final-poster.pptx)</font>). As part of the lab, I recorded a seven-part introductory series on working with data in R. The videos are available <font style="color:#FFCB05;">[here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzl7s8AZ7kwTKY5BZklAiTw)</font>. 


## Awards
In 2023, I was awarded the university-wide Outstanding Research Mentor Award for my work with UROP. I have also received the John W. Kingdon Award for Outstanding Teaching from the Department of Political Science.
