## Undergraduate Mentoring

In 2022-2023, I supervised a lab of Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) students. We used personnel records of correctional officers in Mississippi and Arkansas to examine descriptive representation in the carceral state. The students presented their work at a poster session at MPSA (poster available [here](../final-poster.pptx)). As part of the lab, I recorded a seven-part introductory series on working with data in R. The videos are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzl7s8AZ7kwTKY5BZklAiTw).
