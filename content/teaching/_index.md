## Other
In 2022-2023, I supervised a lab of Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) students at the University of Michigan. We used personnel records of correctional officers in Mississippi and Arkansas to examine descriptive representation in the carceral state. As part of the lab, I recorded a seven-part introductory series on working with data in R.
